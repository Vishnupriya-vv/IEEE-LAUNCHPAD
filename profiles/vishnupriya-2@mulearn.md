# Vishnu Priya

### About Me

> I am Vishnupriya, a recent Computer Science graduate from the College of Engineering Perumon with a 7.8 CGPA. Based in Alappuzha, I have a strong foundation in Python, SQL, C, HTML, and proficiency in CSS, JavaScript, and the MERN stack. My technical skills extend to React and MUI, which I use for developing responsive user interfaces.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have developed strong leadership skills through extensive volunteering during my college years. I have completed projects like a Signature Verification System using Siamese neural networks and a Music Recommendation System using K-means clustering. My most notable project is a full-stack blog application utilizing JWT and bcrypt for authentication, enhancing user experience with Material-UI, React Router, and Context API.

I am passionate about continuous learning and professional development, aspiring to contribute effectively to the IT industry and secure my dream job.

#### Leadership and Influence:

I have demonstrated leadership and influence in various capacities throughout my academic and professional experiences. One notable example is my role as a project lead for a Signature Verification System using Siamese neural networks. I led a team of developers, coordinated tasks, and facilitated clear communication among team members. I have volunteered in numerous college activities, organising events and leading teams, honing my skills in delegation, motivation, and conflict resolution. 

#### Networking:

I have developed strong networking skills through my extensive involvement with IEEE. As Chairperson of the WIE and ComSoc Societies IEEE Student Branch at College of Engineering Perumon, I engaged with professionals, academics, and peers, fostering valuable connections within the tech community. I organized and participated in various events, workshops, and conferences, which enhanced my network and provided me with insights into industry trends and best practices.

I have effectively utilized my networking skills and leadership abilities by conducting a Python session for juniors at the College of Engineering Perumon. This experience allowed me to share my knowledge with emerging developers, fostering their growth and contributing to their understanding of Python.
